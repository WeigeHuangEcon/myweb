abstract = "This paper introduces a Bayesian version of distribution regression. With this method, we are able to estimate the distribution of the entire distribution of the outcome variable and do inference without recourse to the bootstrap. Based on the distribution, the quantiles, variance and among other distributional statistics can be estimated and inference about these distribution statistics can also be made."
