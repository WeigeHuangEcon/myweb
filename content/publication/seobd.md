abstract = "This paper considers Oaxaca-Blinder type decompositions with continuous groups. In particular, we decompose the differences between outcomes at a series of values and at a particular value (with at two particular values as a special case) of the continuous group variable into (i) composition effects and (ii) structural effects. The composition effects are due to differences in observed characteristics (e.g. race or education) for individuals at different values of the continuous group variable. The structural effects are due to differences in the return to characteristics at different values of the continuous group variable. We also consider detailed decompositions of both the composition and structural effects. Our procedure is based on semiparametric smooth coefficient models. This approach is distinct from previous work on decompositions with continuous groups. We develop the limiting distribution of our estimators. We apply our method to decompose earnings differentials for individuals across their parents' income (i.e. parents' income is the continuous group)."
