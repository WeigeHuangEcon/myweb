With this method, we are able to estimate the distribution of the entire distribution of the outcome variable and do inference without recourse to the bootstrap. Based on the distribution, the quantiles, variance and among other distributional statistics can be estimated and inference about these distribution statistics can also be made.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Distribution Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
