We show that the differences in risk premia on factors, especially on market and size factors, account for most of the differences and the differences in factor risks seem to play an insignificant role in aggregate.We also show that the roles that the risk premia on market and size factors play are various at different levels of portfolio returns, implying the market and size factor risk premia are various at different levels of portfolio returns. Also, we find that the risks on some factors seem to be various at different levels of portfolio returns. These findings shed further light on empirical asset pricing.","tags":[],"title":"Decomposing Differences in Portfolio Returns Between North America and Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weige Huang","Emmanuel S.

More specifically, our method helps estimate the distribution for any point on the distribution of the outcome variable but not limited to only a point as using standard distribution regression, which makes straightforward inference on the points on the distribution. It is also straightforward to conduct inference on any distributional statistics like quantiles and variance of interest. We develop asymptotic theorems for our estimators. Combined with counterfactual analysis, we are able to compute counterfactual distributional effects and conduct inferences on these effects. Our application of the method to the Fama-French five-factor model demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in the impact of the market return on the distribution of the portfolio return.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Distribution Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530158400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":["Brantly Callaway","Weige Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"77ce850e19ba3cb30bfb2cf55c9b4279","permalink":"/publication/iim/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iim/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper considers the effect of a continuous treatment on the entire distribution of outcomes after adjusting for differences in the distribution of covariates across different levels of the treatment. Our methodology encompasses dose response functions, counterfactual distributions, and ``distributional policy effects'' depending on the assumptions invoked by the researcher. We propose a three-step estimator that consists of (i) estimating the distribution of the outcome conditional on the treatment and other covariates using quantile regression; (ii) for each value of the treatment, averaging over a counterfactual distribution of the covariates holding the treatment fixed; (iii) manipulating the counterfactual distribution into a parameter of interest.   We show that our estimators converge uniformly to Gaussian processes and that the empirical bootstrap can be used to conduct uniformly valid inference across a range of values of the treatment.  We use our method to study intergenerational income mobility where we consider distributional effects of parents' income on child's income such as (i) the fraction of children with income below the poverty line, (ii) the variance of child's income, and (iii) the inter-quantile range of child's income -- all as a function of parents' income.","tags":null,"title":"Distributional Effects of a Continuous Treatment with an Application on Intergenerational Mobility","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.
