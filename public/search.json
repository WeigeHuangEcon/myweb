We show that the differences in risk premia on factors, especially on market and size factors, account for most of the differences and the differences in factor risks seem to play an insignificant role in aggregate. The results from Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition show that the differences in market and size factor risk premia explain 71.9% and 22.8% of the overall mean difference, respectively. We also show that the roles that the risk premia on market and size factors play vary at different levels of portfolio returns, implying the market and size factor risk premia vary at different levels of portfolio returns. Also, we find that the risks on some factors seem to vary at different levels of portfolio returns.","tags":[],"title":"Decomposing Differences in Portfolio Returns Between North America and Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brantly Callaway","Weige Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1538870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538870400,"objectID":"77ce850e19ba3cb30bfb2cf55c9b4279","permalink":"/publication/iim/","publishdate":"2018-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iim/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper considers the effect of a continuous treatment on the entire distribution of outcomes after adjusting for differences in the distribution of covariates across different levels of the treatment. Our methodology encompasses dose response functions, counterfactual distributions, and ``distributional policy effects'' depending on the assumptions invoked by the researcher. We propose a three-step estimator that consists of (i) estimating the distribution of the outcome conditional on the treatment and other covariates using quantile regression; (ii) for each value of the treatment, averaging over a counterfactual distribution of the covariates holding the treatment fixed; (iii) manipulating the counterfactual distribution into a parameter of interest.   We show that our estimators converge uniformly to Gaussian processes and that the empirical bootstrap can be used to conduct uniformly valid inference across a range of values of the treatment.  We use our method to study intergenerational income mobility where we consider distributional effects of parents' income on child's income such as (i) the fraction of children with income below the poverty line, (ii) the variance of child's income, and (iii) the inter-quantile range of child's income -- all as a function of parents' income.","tags":null,"title":"Distributional Effects of a Continuous Treatment with an Application on Intergenerational Mobility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brantly Callaway","Weige Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1538784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538784000,"objectID":"4ac0d27b7a7bea97bc27d6f259897c07","permalink":"/publication/lige/","publishdate":"2018-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lige/","section":"publication","summary":"The intergenerational elasticity (IGE) is the most common parameter reported in the intergenerational mobility literature. This paper proposes a 'local' intergenerational mobility parameter (LIGE) that allows the effect of parents' income to vary across different values of parents' income.  We also extend this result to an 'adjusted' local intergenerational elasticity (ALIGE) which adjusts for differences in the distribution of observed characteristics at different values of parents' income.  We develop the asymptotic properties of the LIGE and ALIGE, and apply them to study intergenerational mobility using data from the PSID.  We find that the intergenerational elasticity is much larger for low values of parents' income (indicating less mobility) relative to high values of parents' income; adjusting for differences in characteristics reduces the local IGE at all values of parents' income as well as flattening it across different values of parents' income.","tags":null,"title":"Local Intergenerational Elasticities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weige Huang","Emmanuel S.

More specifically, our method helps estimate the distribution for any point on the distribution of the outcome variable but not limited to only a point as using standard distribution regression, which makes straightforward inference on the points on the distribution. It is also straightforward to conduct inference on any distributional statistics like quantiles and variance of interest. We develop asymptotic theorems for our estimators. Combined with counterfactual analysis, we are able to compute counterfactual distributional effects and conduct inferences on these effects. Our application of the method to the Fama-French five-factor model demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in the impact of the market return on the distribution of the portfolio return.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Distribution Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brantly Callaway","Weige Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1538611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538611200,"objectID":"188f3d1af968f645d4c8be7fbcfc6514","permalink":"/publication/seobd/","publishdate":"2018-10-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/seobd/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper considers Oaxaca-Blinder type decompositions with continuous groups.  In particular, we decompose the differences between outcomes at a series of values of the group variable and at a particular value of the group variable into (i) a composition effect and (ii) a structure effect.   The composition effect is due to differences in the distribution of observed characteristics (e.g. race or education) for individuals at two particular values of the continuous group variable.  The structure effect is due to difference in the return to characteristics at two particular values of the continuous group variable.  We also consider detailed decompositions of both the composition and structure effects.  Our procedure is based on semiparametric smooth varying coefficient models that are essentially local (in terms of the continuous group variable) regressions.  This approach is distinct from previous work on decompositions with continuous groups that invoke parametric models.  We develop the limiting distribution of our estimator and show the validity of the wild bootstrap for conducting inference.  We apply our method to decompose earnings differentials for individuals across different values of their parents' income (i.e. parents' income is the continuous group).
