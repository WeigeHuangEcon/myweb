We show that the differences in risk premia on factors, especially on market and size factors, account for most of the differences and the differences in factor risks seem to play an insignificant role in aggregate.We also show that the roles that the risk premia on market and size factors play are various at different levels of portfolio returns, implying the market and size factor risk premia are various at different levels of portfolio returns. Also, we find that the risks on some factors seem to be various at different levels of portfolio returns. These findings shed further light on empirical asset pricing.","tags":[],"title":"Decomposing Differences in Portfolio Returns Between North America and Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\u0026hellip;\n","date":1530158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530158400,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"/privacy/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Policy","type":"page"},{"authors":["Brantly Callaway","Weige Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"77ce850e19ba3cb30bfb2cf55c9b4279","permalink":"/publication/iim/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iim/","section":"publication","summary":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.","tags":null,"title":"Intergenerational Income Mobility: Counterfactual Distributions with a Continuous Treatment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weige Huang","Emmanuel S.

With this method, we are able to estimate the distribution of the entire distribution of the outcome variable and do inference without recourse to the bootstrap. Based on the distribution, the quantiles, variance and among other distributional statistics can be estimated and inference about these distribution statistics can also be made.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian Distribution Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.
